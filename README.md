## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes **4 years of sales data (2017–2020)** from **ATLIQ Hardwares** to uncover valuable business insights.  
I designed an **interactive Power BI dashboard** and used **SQL (and Python for ETL)** to clean, transform, and query the data.  

The goal was to identify **revenue growth patterns, top-selling products, profit trends, and regional performance** to showcase the power of data-driven decision making.
